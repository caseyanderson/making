## description

REWRITE THIS! This prototyping-oriented series of workshops introduces students to the creative affordances of physical computing, or the practice of interfacing digital system with the outside world, by way of hands-on experiments across a continuum of technologies. Students will learn programming concepts (Python3), and basic electronics, as well as strategies for their interaction, via the HUZZAH32. Regular critiques will provide an opportunity for students to share their research and prototypes with their colleagues as well as receive direct feedback from the instructor.

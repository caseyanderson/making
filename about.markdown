This series of interactive workshops introduces students to the creative affordances of programming (Python 3), electronics, their interaction (Physical Computing via the ESP32), and their potential for controlling media (via the Raspberry Pi). Special emphasis is placed on Free Open Source Software (FOSS) technologies that are general purpose and hackable.

Meeting Time: 5:00PM to 6:30PM PST via Zoom (see email for Zoom info)
